# 3_DOF_Robotic_Arm_Simulation_MATLAB_Simulink

Welcome to the 3-DOF Robotic Arm Simulation Repository!

This repository is your gateway to a comprehensive MATLAB and Simulink simulation of a 3-degree-of-freedom robotic arm. It's a powerful tool for understanding, testing, and experimenting with robotic arm control.

Here's what you'll find:

1. **Manual Control:** Want to get hands-on with the robot? Open "URDF\roboticarm\roboticarm manual control\roboticarm.slx." With this simulation, you can operate the robotic arm using intuitive sliders.

2. **Inverse Kinematics:** For advanced users, we offer an "Inverse Kinematics" simulation in "URDF\roboticarm\inverse kinematics file\roboticarm_inversekinematics.slx." Just remember to load "URDF\roboticarm\inverse kinematics file\matlab.mat" into your MATLAB workspace first.

3. **Detailed Model Documentation:** Don't forget to explore the accompanying PDF file. It provides an in-depth understanding of the model, making it a valuable reference for launching new simulation projects or customizing existing ones.

This repository is your go-to resource for diving into the exciting world of robotic arm simulations. Start exploring, experimenting, and enhancing your robotic control skills right here.
